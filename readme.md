# Convert Indentation

This Sublime Text plugin converts file indentation to your setting
with the `convert_indentation` command.

There's also a setting (enabled by default) that converts the indentation
each time a file is opened.

As a note, this only applies to files that are indented with spaces. If
the file is indented with tabs, you shouldn't have to change anything...

Even though this is a useful plugin, it's always important to establish
standards within your organization for how wide tabs should be so that
commit messages like 'Formatting' can be avoided at all costs.

## Installation

To install this plugin, `cd` into your Packages directory for sublime text.
Then, run this command:

    git clone https://github.com/sammarks/subl-convertindentation "./Convert Indentation"

Then you should be good to go!
